# Mice Protein

**AIM**: Finding groups or combinations of proteins whose expression levels can effectively distinguish or differentiate between the different classes of mice in the dataset.

### About Dataset

- There are 72 mice in total: 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice.

- For each protein, there are 15 measurements per mouse, resulting in 570 measurements for control mice and 510 measurements for trisomic mice (total of 1080 measurements per protein).

- The 8 classes of mice are based on combinations of genotype, treatment, and
 behavior.
- The dataset has 82 attributes: 1 for Mouse ID, 77 for protein expression levels, 1 for genotype, 1 for treatment, 1 for behavior, and 1 for class.
-The mice are divided into different groups based on their genotype (control or trisomic, which represents Down syndrome), treatment (memantine or saline), and behavior (context-shock or shock-context).
